# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
the most difficult part was figuring out how to accomplish what we had to acomplish in the read me. Also figuring out the programs was hard, but working with my team and getting a grove on after the first couple helped alot.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Kind of like the ai chat bots we made, I could make this as a database, and then just have the program refrence this for the next move.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I dont really know, but kind of like chess we'd just need a large database of strategies like how chess bots use chess books. Stuffing it with alot of that can find a best move for each move.
